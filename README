LWP-Protocol-virtual


PURPOSE and POINT
This URI schema and Protocol work together to allow virtualization of URL's.

For example, consider the URL's you might use to access a file on CPAN:
	ftp://ftp.perl.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/S/SN/SNOWHARE/...
		Lingua-Stem-0.81.tar.gz
Well, you could just as easily use:
	file://home/mine/cpan/mirror
or
	http://cpan.org/gotta/be/there/somewhere

Well, with virtual:// URLs, you don't have to use any of them.  Or at least not
directly.  You just take a group, and name it in ~/.lwp_virt, and then use
